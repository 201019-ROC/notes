Client Server Architecture:

Software architecture model between computer systems and server systems
	- Communicate over a computer network or on the same computer

Internet
	- Global network of computers acting as clients and servers
		- Clients make requests to a server and expect a response 
	- Different transfer protocols are available to exchange information
		- File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

HTTP
	- Transfer protocol used for information exchange over the world wide web
	- Consists in Requests and Responses exchanged between a Client and a Server
	- File types to be transfered: JSON - JavaScript Object Notation/ XML, HTML Pages, plain text... 
		- HTTP Request
			- HTTP Version
				- current: 1 / 1.1
			- Verb
				- also known as the HTTP method, describes the operation to be performed
				- 4 main ones (Similar to CRUD):
					- Get (Retrieve)
					- Post (Create)
					- Put (Update)
					- Delete (Delete)
			- URL
				- Resource location
			- Header
				- Metadata about your request
			- Body
				- (can be empty)
				- Information to be included
		- HTTP Response
 			- HTTP Version
			- Header
				- Metadata about your response
			- Body
				- Payload (if requesting a resource)
				- can be empty
			 - Status code
				- Status of the request
				- 100 - 500 range
					- 100s: Informational 
					- 200s: Succeess
					- 300s: Redirect
					- 400s: Client-side error
					- 500s: Server-side error

Types of client server architecture:
	- 2-tier architecture
		- Client/application tier and Database tier
		- ie: Games, desktop application
	- 3-tier architecture
		- Presentation layer, Application Layer, Data Layer
		- Separation of concerns
		- ie: any web applications
	- n-tier architecture
		- Breaking down the application in additional layer based on logic to decouple different aspects of the application
		- Can lead to complexity
