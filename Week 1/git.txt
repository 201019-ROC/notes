Git
	- Version Control Tool to manage source code, it can save snapshot of a project on one or more branching path.
		- Repository: files, folders, objects and the branches that represent a project which managed with a .git folder
		- Working directory: Currently active project files and folders
		- Staging area: Area between working directory and the repository where the changes that you make are added before the next commit
		- Commit: Snapshot of the staged changes from a working directory
		- .gitignore: Allows you to specify files that you do not want to be tracked

	- Git flow
		- After initializing a new git repository in a working directory (git init) 
			its files and folders must be added to its staging area (git add [files]) before they can be saved (git commit).
		- New changes in the working directory must be staged and then committed again. 
			New branches can be created or users can switch to an existing branch (git checkout) to explore divergant changes, 
			then eventually combined (git merge).
		- If a local repository is linked to a remote repository, changes made locally can be copied to the remote location (git push), 
			and changes in the remote repository can be copied down to the local version (git pull).
